# OpenGL Tutorials

This repository is a collection of implementations I am putting
together while trying to teach myself the OpenGL improvements of the past ~10 years or so.

I've been working off of the tutorials here:
* (http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/)[http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/]

The above doesn't contain full code, but rather walks you through the process piecemeal,
allowing you to be flexible in your implementations. I decided to make a bit more use of
C++ object-oriented design with mine, and wanted to share.

This is nowhere near my primary job, but I find it nice to branch out a bit and explore
other parts of the computing industry.
